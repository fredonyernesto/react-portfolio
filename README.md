# React Developer Portfolio

## Description
This project is a personal portfolio built using React, designed to showcase my web development skills, including projects and applications I have created. The portfolio highlights my expertise in single-page applications (SPAs), along with a modern design and navigation system that makes it easy to view my work. The portfolio is responsive and follows a mobile-first design approach, ensuring compatibility across various devices.

## User Story
As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, I want to view a deployed React portfolio of work samples so that I can assess whether the developer is a suitable candidate for an open position.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**:
   - Clone the repository.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
   - Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
   - Open the application in your browser at the provided local URL.

2. **Vite Configuration**:
   The project was scaffolded using Vite for its fast development build times. The following scripts are available in the `package.json` file:
   - `"dev": "vite"`
   - `"start": "vite"`
   - `"build": "vite build"`
   - `"preview": "vite preview"`

3. **Customization**:
   If you need to modify the server settings, you can adjust the `vite.config.js` file to customize the server port and other configurations.

4. **Deployment**:
   This project is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Check out the documentation for deployment instructions using Vite and React.
